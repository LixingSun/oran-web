# C4 Architecture Model

## Overview

The [C4 architecture model](https://c4model.com/) is an excellent framework for visualizing software system architectures, regardless of their complexity. It is easy to adopt and valuable for both technical and non-technical stakeholders. By breaking down the system into four hierarchical levels of detail—Context, Container, Component, and Code—the C4 model ensures that everyone maintains a clear and comprehensive understanding of the entire system. 

I have applied the C4 model in my past projects, and it has significantly benefited the entire team. Focusing on the Context and Container levels is particularly effective, and I will share some of my experiences with these levels below. For those interested in the Component and Code levels, I encourage you to visit the [official C4 model website](https://c4model.com/) for more details.
