    "summary": "The C4 architecture model is an excellent framework for visualizing software system architectures, regardless of their complexity. It is easy to adopt and valuable for both technical and non-technical stakeholders. By breaking down the system into four hierarchical levels of detail—Context, Container, Component, and Code—the C4 model ensures that everyone maintains a clear and comprehensive understanding of the entire system."
